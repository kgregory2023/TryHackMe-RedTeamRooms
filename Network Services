# TryHackMe Room Report

## Room Name
*Network Services*

## Date
*10-19-2025*

## Room Objective
Enumerating and exploiting common network services.

## Tools Used
1. Nmap.
2. enum4linux
3. TCPDUMP listener
4. msfvenom
5. netcat
6. Hydra

## Methodology

## SMB
1. SMB Enumeration.
- Performed port/service reconnasiance found three running services on target.

- Performed enum4linux enumeration to find Workgroup name, machine name and OS version and share folder.

2. SMB Exploitation
- Found file under profiles directory after gaining passwordless access using false username.
- Identified Profile Owner's name, Title of Department manager and method of connecting to company server from home.
- Found authentication keys inside .ssh directory and rsa, remote server access key
- downloaded and used chmod 600 to open the rsa key.
- downloaded and found login for profile user in rsa public key.
- Logged in as profile user using ssh and id_rsa authentication key pathway to gain access to account.
- Found flagg in the text file.

## Telnet
1. Telnet Enumeration
- Performed port/service reconnasiance found running services on target using nmap -A -Pn -T4 -p-
- Found evidence of a backdoor after port/service scanning

2. Telnet Exploitation
- Logged into backdoor using telnet port 
- Created tcpdump listener to log telnet backdoor inputs.
- Created reverse shell using msfvenom with payload
- Established netcat listener on host machine
- Copied Payload into telnet target backdoor, recieved connection response
- ran whoami, found flag

## FTP
1. FTP Enumeration
- Performed port/service reconnasiance found running services on target using nmap -A -Pn -T4 -p-
- Logged into FTP via target IP using anonymous credentials
- Downloaded file and gathered information for exploitation phase

2. FTP Exploitation
- Used Hydra for password Brute force exploitation for the profile user.
- Logged into the FTP server as Mike



## Key Findings

  ## SMB
- Summarize vulnerabilities, credentials, flags found.
- Three open ports, ssh, SAMBA 139 SMB and SAMBA 445 smb.
PORT    STATE SERVICE     VERSION
22/tcp  open  ssh         OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.13 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.6.2
MAC Address: 02:E6:C4:27:0E:17 (Unknown)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel

- Located interesting share to exploit, "Profiles"
- Located file in SMB Share titled "Work From Home.txt"
- Found Department Manager's name, method of connecting from home via SSH and it department email address.
- found John Cactus login using rsa public key, cactus@polosmb.
- logged in as John Cactus via SSH and opened the smb.txt file to get the flag.

  ## Telnet
- Port running unknown service on 8012/tcp
- included reference to Skiddy's Backdoor belonging to someone named Skidy.
- Succesfully logged into the Skiddy's backdoor via telnet 8012
- msfvenom payload is mkfifo
- established netcat port 4444 on Host
- receieved connection response to 35824, ran whoami then ls and found the flag.

  ## FTP
- Found 3 open ports 21,22,80
- Running services FTP, ssh, HTTP
- Specifically running vsFTPd 3.0.5
- Found file 2020 public notice.txt
- Found name of owner(Mike) and details of FTP server being down over the weekend and backups put on his account
- Successfully gained the password of "Mike" as "Password"
- Found the flag.txt file and gained the flag text!

## Challenges Faced
- No challenges faced in this room

## Final Outcome
TBD
