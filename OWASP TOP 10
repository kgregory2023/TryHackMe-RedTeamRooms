## 1. Command Injection
ls = root drpepper.txt
0 non root users
whoami(Linux) shows  www-data 
cat etc/passwd shows usr/sbin/nologin 
cat /etc/os-release shows Linux OS version

## 2. Broken Authentication
Using extra characters such as "john" or "bob"
instead of john or bob in username field

## 3. Sensitive Data Exposure
- Used web inspect recon to identify leaked comment for database named assets
- Used search query to access database directories found db name
- Used sqlite to access database
- Found the hash file
- Used online hashtool to crack the hash
- Logged in as admin

## 4. XML External Entity
<!DOCTYPE note SYSTEM "note.dtd">
<note>
    <to>falcon</to>
    <from>feast</from>
    <heading>hacking</heading>
    <body>XXE attack</body>
</note>

!DOCTYPE note -  Defines a root element of the document named note
!ELEMENT note - Defines that the note element must contain the elements: "to, from, heading, body"
!ELEMENT to - Defines the to element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT from - Defines the from element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT heading  - Defines the heading element to be of type "#PCDATA"
!ELEMENT body - Defines the body element to be of type "#PCDATA"

example lastname change payload
<!DOCTYPE replace [<!ENTITY name "feast"> ]>
 <userInfo>
  <firstName>falcon</firstName>
  <lastName>&name;</lastName>
 </userInfo>

## 5. Broken Access Control
link is http://chicken/user=1
broken is ability to view http://chicken/user=2

## 6. Security Misconfiguration
Webapp pensive notes.
- Recon google search led to pubic default credentials leaked on github page for the app
- Reset default credentials on app
- logged in successfully and found the flag

## 7. XSS Scripting
Popup's (<script>alert(“Hello World”)</script>) - Creates a Hello World message popup on a users browser.
Writing HTML (document.write) - Override the website's HTML to add your own (essentially defacing the entire page).
XSS Keylogger (http://www.xss-payloads.com/payloads/scripts/simplekeylogger.js.html) - You can log all keystrokes of a user, capturing their password and other sensitive information they type into the webpage.
Port scanning (http://www.xss-payloads.com/payloads/scripts/portscanapi.js.html) - A mini local port scanner (more information on this is covered in the TryHackMe XSS room).


## 8. Insecure Deserialization
- Signing up for webapp
- Going to inspect to the storage tab for cookies
- Modify values, then relogin for example http://myapp/admin
- Can also be executed via rce


## 9. Components Known Vulnerabilities
- Exploit-DB CSE bookstore


## 10. Insufficent Loggin and Monitoring
- viewed logfile to determine brute force login attempt
